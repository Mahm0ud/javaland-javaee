### Azure Managed Identity

You are required to input the ID of a user-assigned managed identity that has the **Contributor** at the subscription level of the current subscription.

To create a user-assigned managed identity, follow the steps in [Manage user-assigned managed identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal).

You will need the resource ID of the identity. To obtain ID of the identity: go to Azure Portal; open the identity **Overview** page; select **JSON View** and copy the **Resource ID**.
